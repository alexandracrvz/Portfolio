# Project Overview

## Project Description

Disclaimer: This is Beta 1 and is subject to change as I gain more skills and experience in my career as a Software Developer. 

I will build a personal portfolio. The portfolio will be a website showcasing myself, skills, projects, and contact information as a Software Engineer. Anyone visiting my portfolio website will be able to interact with my content and get familiar with who I am as well as the skills, and ideas I have to bring to the table as a Junior Developer.
